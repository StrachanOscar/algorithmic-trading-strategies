A collection of algorithmic trading strategies I've written.

### Simple Breakout Strategy
Executes a buy order when the instrument's price exceeds the historical high recorded over the dynamic lookback period determined by the instrument's delta.
A trailing stop-loss rises with the instrument's price as it runs, and the position is sold once the price falls below the threshold.
